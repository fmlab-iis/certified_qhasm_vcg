A {\em ring} $\mathcal{R} = (R, 0, 1, +, \times)$ consists of a set
$R$, $0$, $1 \in R$ with $0 \neq 1$, and $+$, $\times$ binary
functions over $R$ that
\begin{itemize}
\item $(R, 0, +)$ is an abelian group: $(a + b) + c = a + (b
  + c)$, $a + b = b + a$, $a + 0 = a$, and $a + (-a) = 0$ for every
  $a, b, c \in R$; 
\item $(R, 1, \times)$ is a group: $(a \times b) \times c = a
  \times (b \times c)$, $a \times 1 = 1 \times a = a$, $a \times
  a^{-1} = a^{-1} \times a = 1$ for every $a, b, c \in R$; and 
\item $\times$ is distributive over $+$: $a \times (b + c) = a \times
  b + a \times c$ for every $a, b, c \in R$.
\end{itemize}
If $\times$ is commutative, the ring $\mathcal{R}$ is
\emph{commutative}. $a \in R$ is a \emph{zero divisor} if there is an
$x \in R$ such that $a \times x = 0$. An \emph{integral domain} is a
commutative ring without zero divisors.

We write $\mathbb{B} = \{ \mathit{ff}, \mathit{tt} \}$ for the Boolean
domain. Let $\bbfN$ and $\bbfZ$ denote positive and all integers
respectively. For any prime number $\varrho$, $\bbfGF(\varrho)$ is the
Galois field of order $\varrho$. We focus on Galois fields of very
large orders, say, $\myprime = 2^{255} - 19$. 

Fix a set of variables $\vx$. $\bbfF[\vx]$ is the set of multivariant
polynomials over $\vx$ with coefficients in $\bbfF$.
