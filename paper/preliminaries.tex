We write $\mathbb{B} = \{ \mathit{ff}, \mathit{tt} \}$ for the Boolean
domain. 
Let $\bbfN$ and $\bbfZ$ denote positive and all integers
respectively. For any prime number $\varrho$, $\bbfGF(\varrho)$ is the
Galois field of order $\varrho$. We focus on Galois fields of very
large orders, say, $\myprime = 2^{255} - 19$. 

Fix a set of variables $\vx$. $\bbfF[\vx]$ is the set of multivariant
polynomials over $\vx$ with coefficients in $\bbfF$.
