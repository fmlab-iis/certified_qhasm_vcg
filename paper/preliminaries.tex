Let $\bbfN$ and $\bbfZ$ denote positive and all integers
respectively. For any prime number $p$, $\bbfGF(p)$ is the Galois
field of order $p$. We focus on Galois fields of very large orders,
say, $p = 2^{255} - 19$. 

Fix a set of variables $\vx$. $\bbfF[\vx]$ is the set of multivariant
polynomials over $\vx$ with coefficients in $\bbfF$.
