Given $q, q' \in Q$ and $p \in P$, we reduce the problem of checking
$\models \hoaretriple{q}{p}{q'}$ to a problem of checking (modular)
polynomial equalities under a system of polynomial equations over
integral domains. The reduction is carried out by the following three
transformations:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Program slicing. To improve efficiency, the segments of the program $p$
  irrelevant to the post-condition $q$ are removed by program slicing 
  (Section~\ref{subsection:translation:slicing}). 
\item Static single assignments. The sliced program is transformed
  into static single assignments. Variables in the pre- and
  post-conditions are renamed accordingly
  (Section~\ref{subsection:translation:static-single-assignment}).
\item Multivariant polynomial equations. The resultant program
  specification is transformed into checking (modular)
  polynomial equalities under a system of polynomial equations
  (Section~\ref{subsection:translation:multivariant-polynomial-equations}).
\end{enumerate}

For each transformation, we give an algorithm and establish the
correctness of the algorithm in \coq. Particularly, a semantics
for our domain specific language is given and 
$\models \hoaretriple{q}{p}{q'}$ is formalized in \coq. The
correctness of transformations is then established by formal \coq
proofs. For program slicing and static single assignments, we
construct machine-checkable proofs for the soundness and completeness
of the two transformations. For multivariant polynomial equations,
another \coq-certified proof shows the soundness of the transformation
from $\models \hoaretriple{q}{p}{q'}$ to an algebraic problem over
(modular) polynomial equations. In the following subsections, we
elaborate the transformations and their correctness in details.
