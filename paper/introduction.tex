\todo{Bo-Yin, please motivate why the correctness of Montgomery ladder
step in Curve25519 is important for slightly over .5 page.}

We have the following contributions:
\begin{itemize}
\item We propose a domain specific language for modeling low-level
  cryptographic programs over large finite fields.
\item We give a certified verification condition generator from
  programs written in our domain specific language to polynomial
  (modulo) equations over integral domains.
\item We verify arithmetic computation over a large finite field and a
  critical program (the Montgomery ladder step) automatically in a
  reasonable amount of time.  
\item To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first automatic
  and certified verification on real cryptographic programs with
  minimal human intervention.
\end{itemize}
