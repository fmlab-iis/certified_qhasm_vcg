Recall that X25519 is based on the elliptic curve Curve25519. 
Cryptographic primitives of the key exchange protocol perform
sequences of algebraic operations on the Abelian group $\bbfG$ induced
by Curve25519, not on the finite field $\bbfGF(\varrho)$. As
aforementioned, the binary operation $\Gplus$ requires another
sequence of arithmetic computation over $\bbfGF(\varrho)$. Errors
could still be introduced or even implanted in implementations of
$\Gplus$. Correctness of arithmetic constructs over $\bbfGF(\varrho)$
does not necessarily imply the correctness of the mathematical
construct in X25519. The Montgomery Ladderstep is the mathematical
construct widely used to implement $\Gplus$ on Curve25519. We 
verify a low-level implementation of the mathematical construct in
this experiment.

Peter Montgomery derived a sequence of computations, now usually known
as "the Montgomery Ladderstep", to compute both $P+Q$ and $[2]Q$
simultaneously and efficiently knowing $\pm(P-Q)$.  The ladderstep can
be achieved only the x coordinates on a set of curves today known as
Montgomery curves. This is known as a differential addition chain and
is one of the fundamental ways to avoid timing attacks.  That is,
starting from points $[n]P$ and $[n+1]P$, one can get either $[2n]P$
and $[2n+1]P$, or $[2n+1]P$ and $[2n+2]P$ in a time-constant manner,
with the difference between the two points always remaining $\pm P$
using the Ladderstep, provided that there is a time-constant way to
swap the two (which there usually is).   This is equivalent to
computing either $2n$ or $2n+1$ from $n$ and is sufficient to compute
any $[n]P$ where n has a constant bitlength.   For curves not
equivalent to a Montgomery curve, a variant known as the "Co-Z ladder"
is available to effect the same differential addition chain. 

Montgomery's formulas and his steps are well known since his original
paper.  (include Montgomery ladderstep diagram and Montgomery's
original equations).  We show that the program carrys out a
computation equivalent to his formulas.  In fact, we show that the
doubling part of the formula has a coefficient of 4 in both the
numerator and denominator that is not in Peter Montgomery's formula
(insert cite here). 

Let $p \in G$ be an element of the group $\bbfG$ and hence a point on
the elliptic curve Curve25519. We write $n \cdot p$ for
$\overbrace{p \Gplus \cdots \Gplus p}^n \in G$ when $n \in \bbfN$. A
crucial mathematical construct in X25519 is to compute the
$x$-coordinate of $n \cdot p$ for $n \in \bbfN$. The na\"ive
implementation would follow the equation (\ref{eq:curve25519-group})
and compute both $x$- and $y$-coordinates with, in particular, a
division operation $\Fdiv$ in $\bbfGF(\varrho)$. In~\cite{M:87:SPEC},
a more efficient implementation is proposed. 

$np = x_n \Fdiv z_n$.
